[x] add db

[x] render rows from model in listview
[ ] selected row should be inverse fg/bg colors or something more subtle
[x] add create row view for creating a new entry
[ ] add encryption with a private key or password
[ ] add sorting for columns
[x] add CMake
[ ] add command line args
[ ] add license
[ ] maybe the model/observers need templates to decouple them from PasswordEntry?
[x] add password entry class
[x] add string padding functions that show ellipses (like jakewilsonfl@...)
[ ] add view entry class
[ ] add edit entry class
[ ] render footer which shows commands
[x] fix spaces still being highlighted when switching lines

[ ] what happened to the (ListView) border??
[x] create password_entry table on engine init if it doesn't exist
[x] make password_entry.id AUTO INC
[ ] make select_password_entries_cb a lambda?
[x] arrow keys go the wrong way
[ ] add debug flag to program and load a debug dump to the db in that case

[ ] allow logger to accept multiple string args (e.g. logger << "cool" << "hi")
[ ] add command for going forward/backwards by a 'page' which will be a runtime-val depending on LINES
[ ] add readme
[ ] move m_window and get_input to IView
[ ] have two additional windows - header and footer so each screen doesn't have to render them
