[x] add db
[ ] print header with cool rubeus ascii text
[ ] add line/row numbers in yellow (like vim)
[x] display rows in db
[x] render rows from model in listview
[x] selected row should be inverse fg/bg colors or something more subtle
[x] add create row view for creating a new entry
[ ] add encryption with a private key or password
[ ] add sorting for columns
[x] add CMake
[ ] add command line args
[ ] add license
[ ] maybe the model/observers need templates to decouple them from PasswordEntry?
[x] add password entry class
[x] add string padding functions that show ellipses (like jakewilsonfl@...)
[ ] add view entry class
[ ] add edit entry class
[ ] render footer which shows commands
[x] fix spaces still being highlighted when switching lines
[ ] add arrow key support as well as j/k (broken again - I think has to do with timeout? see 34)
[x] what happened to the (ListView) border??
[x] create password_entry table on engine init if it doesn't exist
[x] make password_entry.id AUTO INC
[ ] make select_password_entries_cb a lambda?
[x] arrow keys go the wrong way
[ ] add debug flag to program and load a debug dump to the db in that case
[ ] put db init commands into a file and read it at the beginning (for creating the table, etc...)
[ ] allow logger to accept multiple string args (e.g. logger << "cool" << "hi")
[ ] add command for going forward/backwards by a 'page' which will be a runtime-val depending on LINES
[ ] add readme
[ ] implement header window
[x] implement backspace
[x] handle character presses on create view
[ ] arrow keys seem to register as escape ??
[x] remove model from ListView and have Rubeus pass in needed data instead
[x] rename 'website' to 'title' for password_entry
[x] insert PasswordEntry when exiting CreateView
[ ] password_entry is re-selected from after every insert - probably okay to just append instead
[x] make IModel and IView unique_ptrs in Rubeus
[ ] add `dirty` flag to `PasswordEntry`; when rubeus exits, update all `dirty` entries to the db
[x] bug where if window size < list size, scrolling is weird
[x] add pagination for list
[x] extend commandview length
[x] change commands when views change
[x] COL_BUFFER should be passed into windows as the starting x cord
[x] remove #defines in ListView and replace with const

[ ] throw exception in Engine if password failed to insert
[ ] add delete functionality
[ ] limit length of title and username
[ ] deal with overflowing passwords better
[ ] change how commands are displayed
[x] add ssl to the project
[ ] screen is flickering - maybe rendering too much each render
[x] might not need libssl, only libcrypto
[x] add scrypt-kdf
[ ] fine-tune scrypt params if need be
[ ] only need to type password twice if it's the first time opening rubeus (check if db exists?)
